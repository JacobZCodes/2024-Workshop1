# Welcome to Workshop Yearbook!

## How to add your profile to the yearbook?

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a folder inside of the `/showcase` folder
3. Add an `index.qmd` file to your newly created folder
4. The header of your `index.qmd` file should follow this example (feel free to add as many categories as you see fit):

```{.yaml filename="index.qmd"}
---
title: "Git Money"
image: <a link to my picture>
alt: "Git Money"
href: <My LinkedIn Link>
code: <My Github Link>
categories:

```
